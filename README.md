zombie-menu
===========
Our zombie.cfg holds a new Cube 2: Sauerbraten-menu for your (F7) key - written entirely in CubeScript. It helps answering frequently asked questions and provides useful functions like a playerlist with goto, follow and un/spec, mini-tutorials and settings for (coop-)editing. It's also designed to make Master being less nerve-wrecking! =P
Please feel free to improve it, or tell us what you would like to see added or changed (texts, functions, anything!). Just like our map, it's free software! :D
The Zombie menu is a Sauerbraten addon, but could work on other Cube Engine games, with little adjustments.
