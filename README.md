zombie-menu
===========
The Zombie menu is a Sauerbraten addon, but may work on other Cube Engine games.
Our zombie.cfg is a new menu on your (F7) key, that helps us answering frequently asked newbie questions as well as providing useful functions, mini-tutorials and settings for editing in-game.
It's also designed to make Master being less nerve-wrecking! =P
Please feel free to improve it, or tell us what you would like to add or change (texts, functions, anything!). It's free software either! :D
