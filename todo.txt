To do:
	- guibutton "frequent use:" => should it really open the server browser?
	
	- buggy-master-mode-switch

	- make a better readme
		=> explain how to add/remove other translations/license information

	- different map realated todo's for every language?? makes this sense at all?
		=> if yes change the way the todos get saved
			=> saves all to ONE list, so it would be possible to easily delete all todos (better chances to keep the config.cfg clean)

	- save the map related todo's and background thoughts into lists, not as inviduals vars
		=> will make it easier to keep the config.cfg clean!
		
	- the var "zMULTICNLIST" gets "initialized" with a EMPTY value!? => why? it will get initialized everytime the config gets reloaded, as long as it dont get a value

	- for what excatly is the var zQD used?

	- the AI is impossible to realise in cubescript, remove the hashtags-comments
		=> maybe create a remod script for this, but remove it definitly from the client script

	- would be useful too add a /clearsleep before /exec autoexec.cfg
		=> any arguments against this idea?
		
	- console scrollable with mouse wheel
		=> if this is active, you cant switch your weapons anymore with mousewheel
			=> so is it useful at all?
			
	- Reset the cool-down countdown if you press K again (suicide shortcut)
	
	- Possible to change the key to which the menu is binded
	


ALREADY-KNOWN-BUGS:
	- 	Todo's cant handle with "
	- 	Make the new countdown function working

This is a have-definitly-to-be-done-todo-before-finalize-3.2-todo:
	-	fix all known bugs
	-	Dynamic, multi-language NNA's!
	- 	Check if zDeleteLicense is still working
	-	Create wiki posts to explain how to use the language/license api
	
Translations Notes:
	- English Translate:
		* "current" should be called "background"
		* title in the NNA: keep "teleport" named "teleport" and not "teleporter", because the ent its called "teleport", 
			I expect that a lot of user would try to use /newent teleporter 
		
	- German Translate:
		* "Cube" should be in German "Cube" too, think of the game name :P
		* "Map" should be also in German "Map"
